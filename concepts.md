`Busybox` is a minimal set of tools typically present in a unix-like operating system. It does not contain a kernel and is not an operating system.
`Alpine` is a minimal Linux distribution that contains everything necessary to boot a kernel and initiate a session.
`Ubuntu` is a consumer-focused Linux distribution with many tools, utilities, and applications needed for an end-user focused operating system.

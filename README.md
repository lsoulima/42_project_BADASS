BGP EVPN is based on BGP (RFC 4271) and its extensions MP-BGP (RFC4760).
BGP is the routing protocol that drives the Internet. Through MP-BGP extensions, it
can be used to carry reachability information (NLRI) for various protocols (IPv4, IPv6,
L3 VPN and in this case, EVPN). EVPN is a special family for publishing information
about MAC addresses and the end devices that access them..
